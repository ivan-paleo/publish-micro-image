**How to publish microscope images**

This good-practice document is directed at archaeologists and paleontologists working with microscopes, but anyone working with microscope images might learn a few things here.  
Microscopes now deliver digital images. However, digital images are different to analog images and to what the observer/analyst sees through the oculars. Therefore, digital images have specific properties that must be reported in publications, so that other researchers have the necessary details to assess the published images and also so that they can repeat/reproduce these images.  
This document is by no means exhaustive and is limited in scope on purpose.
